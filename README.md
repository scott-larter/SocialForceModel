  Crosswalk Scenario Investigated
  
  Pygame is needed to run the program (32-bit or 64-bit).   
  
  How-To: Run simulator_Crosswalk.py in a python console
  
  The source code runs well in Python 2.7. The core computation runs OK in Python 3, but not sure about displaying the simulation result in Pygame with Python 3.

Thank Shen Shen for his original work in Python. His coding work is wonderful.  
The repository below is forked from https://github.com/godisreal/SocialForceModel which I modified to investigate the crosswalk scenario.
